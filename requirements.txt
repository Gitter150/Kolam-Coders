# requirements.txt

# --- Core Libraries for MVP ---
opencv-python-headless  # For image processing (headless is smaller, good for servers)
numpy                   # For numerical operations and matrix manipulation
matplotlib              # For plotting and generating kolam images

# --- Libraries for Advanced Features & Future Use ---
Pillow                  # Powerful image manipulation library (PIL)
scipy                   # For advanced scientific and geometric algorithms
networkx                # For graph-based analysis of kolam paths

# --- For the Web Interface (Stretch Goal) ---
Flask                   # To build a simple web server and API

# --- Developer Tools (Optional but Recommended) ---
black                   # For auto-formatting your code
flake8                  # For checking your code against style guides
